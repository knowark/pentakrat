					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Pentakrat is a decentralized platform that materializes
						the links of trust established in representational systems:</p>
					<p>For <b>Leaders</b> the platform provides accurate information about the <i>level of
						support</i> their proposals build upon their target audiences and the eventual
					  capability of establishing a <i>closer relationship</i> with them, if they so want
						to. Furthermore it paves the way to deploy mechanisms to <i>fund their
						campaigns</i> and the ideas they stand for.</p>
					<p>For <b>Supporters</b>, it gives them the <i>transparency</i> they deserve when they put
						their trust in their representatives. It also provides a mechanism to safely
						<i>second the guiding directions</i> they align to, and most importantly, it allows
						them to <i>change their support target</i> whenever they feel their interests are
						no longer being well represented.</p>
					<p>For <b>Investors</b>, it is an opportunity to hold an asset that is backed up by
						the level of <i>trust in organizational leadership</i>. It is a way to <i>strengthen
						electoral processes</i> by providing the resources they need while preventing
						their coercion by selfish agendas. In short, it is a way to <i>invest with
						democratic purpose</i>.</p>

				<!-- Why -->
				<article id="why">
					<h2 class="major">Why using it?</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""/></span>

					<p>A great part of our lives depends on the decisions that others
						make on our behalf, especially regarding common resources
						administration. One could go further and say that our fate is
						determined by those who have climbed the political pyramid with
						each of us acting like the steps of a ladder. As social
						individuals, we do that because efficient leadership allows us to
						look for opportunities beyond the horizon and collectively benefit
						from them by following unified and coordinated guidelines. By
						trusting in those who propose to manage some dimension of our lives
						for our greatest benefit, we concede a stake of our autonomy to
						focus in other areas in which we think we can make a bigger
						difference. It is a contract like any other in which one party
						commits to provide an orchestration service, in exchange of
						recognition, status and economic compensation.</p>

					<p>It is intriguing to observe, however, how some of those who have
						acquired access to power through their promises, forget about them
						just after realizing that they have already claimed the bounty
						without having to go hunting.  Moreover, if they manage to grasp an
						opportunity to tilt the balance in their favour, they change the
						rules of the game by coercing those who are beneath them and that
						way secure their authority. Such acts are vile and deceptive, but
						they happen all across the world and especially in those places
						where institutions are not strong enough to align the social actors
						they were designed to govern. Despite corruption being something
						that has existed since the outset of civilization and it is naive
						to aim at a problem that has multiple forms and keeps on evolving,
						perhaps we have achieved a point in which the technological tools
						we have developed to aid in our informational, logistical and
						commercial activities, can provide the additional utility of
						designing a sociological infrastructure that is able to establish
						fair and inalienable interaction mechanisms for all.
						<i>Pentakrat</i> is fond of that vision and is an initiative to
						experiment, learn and share the outcomes of those kind of
						interventions. If for any chance it raises the interest in
						developing more solutions to tackle these kind of organizational
						challenges, it would have fulfilled its mission and declare
						success. Please join us with your participation and feedback. Let's
						try this out and see what happens!</p>

				<!-- How -->
				<article id="how">
					<h2 class="major">How does it work?</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Pentakrat uses <i>blockchain technology</i> to permanently and
						transparently record the bonds of trust established between
						<i>Leaders</i> and their <i>Supporters</i> in the context of
						fulfilling a determined <i>Mission</i>. A *Mission* is any cause
						that has value for the community within a defined period and that
						requires the coordinated effort of some of its members.
						Technically, each <i>Mission</i> is a <i>Smart Contract</i> of the
						chains of <i>Trust</i> built up by the relationships that are
						formed when a <i>Supporter</i> chooses his <i>Leader</i>. This
						precise encounter is <i>Pentakrat's</i> essence, as it creates the
						<i>Non-Fungible Token (NFT)</i> that supports its ecosystem. For
						this community, <i>Trust</i> is worth more than gold.</p>
