# Pentakrat

A decentralized platform that materializes the links of trust established in
representational systems.

## Leaders

For **Leaders** the platform provides accurate information about the *level of
support* their proposals build upon their target audiences and the eventual
capability of establishing a *closer relationship* with them, if they so want
to.  Furthermore it paves the way to deploy mechanisms to *fund their
campaigns* and the ideas they stand for.

## Supporters

For **Supporters**, it gives them the *transparency* they deserve when they put
their trust in their representatives. It also provides a mechanism to safely
*second the guiding directions* they align to, and most importantly, it allows
them to *change their support* target whenever they fell their interests are
no longer being well represented.

## Investors

For **Investors**, it is an opportunity to hold an asset that is backed up by
the level of *trust in organizational leadership*. It is a way to *strengthen
electoral processes* by providing the resources they need while preventing
their coercion by selfish agendas. In short, it is a way to *invest with
democratic purpose*.
